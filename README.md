# freecad-slic3r-tools
Tools for running Slic3r from FreeCAD

This module lets you quickly export all visible parts in the current document, and open the resulting .stl file in Slic3r.
You can also set up a default print profile, and directly get information about the resources that would be used to print it,
as well as quickly generate the .gcode file.
